# react-clicky-game
A memory game built using REACT.  The purpose of this application is to understand the way react manages the virtual-DOM and how each component is updated rather than the entire DOM. During the building of this application, I am starting to understand the child relationships as well as how props can add to components.  This learning process lead to this game.  A game where you are to only click each image once.  It is trickier than you think!

This REACT application uses the following yarn packages: 
- [bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap)
- [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) 
- [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)
- [react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts)
